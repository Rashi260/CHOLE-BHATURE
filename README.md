# CHOLE-BHATURE

These are fluffy deep fried Indian breads served with chole which are chickepeas cooked in a spicy masala. The refined flour dough for the bhature needs to be left to ferment for a few hours before being rolled into oval shaped discs and deep-fried. Chole-bhature is one of those few things that are worth the calories!
